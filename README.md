# Classic Cars Sales Dashboard

## CAPSTONE POWER BI PROJECT

### Problem Statement:
A small company named Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data, and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.

To address this issue, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool that can help them manage and analyze their sales data effectively. They have shortlisted Microsoft Power BI and SQL as the BI tools for this project.

### Task:
The goal of the capstone project is to design and implement a BI solution using Power BI and SQL that can help the company manage and analyze their sales data effectively.

## Project Execution:
1. **Prepare Import:** Load the `mysqlsampledatabase` data into the MySQL Database and connect it to Power BI.
2. **Review Database Relationship:** Review the database relationship created by Power BI.
3. **Data Validation:** Validate the data using tables in Power BI and match the values with the provided data.
4. **Data Transformation:** Transform and clean the data as needed using Power Query Editor within Power BI Desktop. This involves renaming columns, removing null values, and removing unnecessary columns like images.
5. **Column Creation:** Create columns in Power Query, like the Employee column, that concatenates the firstName and lastName of the employee.
6. **Calculated Columns:** Create calculated columns using DAX formulas. Verify them in either MySQL or Excel files.
7. **Visualization:** Build visualizations by dragging fields from data tables onto the canvas in Power BI Desktop.

## Measures Created(DAX):
1.	**Total Sales**	= SUMX('classicmodels orderdetails','classicmodels orderdetails'[quantityOrdered] * 'classicmodels orderdetails'[priceEach])

2.	**Total Profit**	          = [Total Sales] - SUMX('classicmodels orderdetails', RELATED('classicmodels products'[buyPrice]) * 'classicmodels orderdetails'[quantityOrdered])

3.	**Total no. of Product**    = countrows('classicmodels products')

4.	**Total no. of Orders**     = COUNTROWS('classicmodels orderdetails')

5.	**Total Employees** 	      = DISTINCTCOUNT('classicmodels employees'[Employee])

6.	**Total Customers** 	      = DISTINCTCOUNT('classicmodels customers'[customerNumber])

7.	**sum of quantity ordered** = sum('classicmodels orderdetails'[quantityOrdered])

8.	**Last year sales**	        = CALCULATE(SUMX('classicmodels orderdetails','classicmodels orderdetails'[quantityOrdered] * 'classicmodels orderdetails'[priceEach]),
                                  SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('classicmodels orders'[orderDate].[Date]))

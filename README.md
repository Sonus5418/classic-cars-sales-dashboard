## CAPSTONE POWER BI PROJECT Problem Statement:
A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.
To address this issue, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (Bl) tool that can help them manage and analyze their sales data effectively. They have shortlisted Microsoft Power BI and SQL as the Bl tools for this project.
## Task: 
 The goal of the capstone project is to design and implement a Bl solution using Power BI and SQL that can help the company manage and analyze their sales data effectively. 
## Classic Model Car’s Dashboard : 
         Sales View – To display the top-performing and bottom-performing Products with different key metrics. 
         Employee View – This includes the integrated view of key insights for Employees.
         Key Insights – To display the findings or key insights we learnt from analysis.
